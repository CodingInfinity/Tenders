\section{Why I want to do the project}
As an advanced computer science enthusiast and mathematician, I appreciate algorithms in there beauty and creativity, and hence understand the need for an open source, stable, efficient and user friendly platform that will allow industry, education and researchers can use to study alogorithm and there associated properties in much more detail. Allowing parties to compare software, algorithms and various software can lead to much more transparency in the software industry by allowing one to validate claims made by parties about the performance and optimization of there software. Myself and my team have know that we will be able to make a success of the project.

%I am writing this letter to express my desire to work and innovate for you, for the world.
%
%
%Since 8 years I've only been programming in C++, Java for school projects, so i have good skill for solve problems with  algorithmic logic, %i thought that would be ideal for me but something was missing, the beauty.
%When i started to be a web developer in 2010 i found the missing piece , could do almost anything  with attractive interfaces and good %performance.
%The last years of my study at university dedicated myself to show  at the students that programming was not only easy  also is wonderful %too.
%
%I started a project called skoolfre,for now it's just paper but i want to one day become a reality. For this i have much to learn. Luckily i %like  learning. I have a dream, help to build a free university online with  a concept like duolingo.
%
%I recently  had a  contract work for the company Gigantes Agroindustria  where i collaborate  develop some applications they needed to %improve administrative parts for the  company.This contract end. I have a good feeling knowing that my time in the company improved  them %software and me like a person.
%
%Today I knock  your door for a chance to grow and realize my dream of work in a software development company. I hope in my heart that you %will open doors for me and give me the opportunity to do my best work with all my effort just for you.
