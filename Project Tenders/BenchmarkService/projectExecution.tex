\subsection{Informing the Client}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Since the client is on site we will want to have weekly meetings where we will report on what has been done in the past week and suggest and discuss what will be done in the coming week. This is also in line with die aglie development methodology that has been chosen.
	\item Email will be used if the team has questions for the client that can not wait until the next meeting.
	\item The client may potentially have access to a scrum server the developers are using for the project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What Will The Client Receive}
On completion of the development cycle the client will receive the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The functional application, which includes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The functioning web interface
		\item The backend which will run the bechmarking tests and record the results
	\end{itemize}
	\item The source code for the functional application
	\item Associated build files
	\item The source code for all unit and integration tests
	\item The full spesification documentation as required by the agile development methodology
	\item (possibly) a simple user manual, but this will be debated since part of the goals of the project are to develop a generic, easy to use benchmarking system that the user can hopefully use without much training
\end{itemize}
