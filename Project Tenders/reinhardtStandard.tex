\aboutme{
As a third year Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria I have excelled at my first and second
year subjects. I received an award as the top BSc Computer Science student in 2014 and the second best BSc
Computer Science student in 2015. I have always focused on gaining useful knowledge and mastering con-
cepts and the good marks are just a result of that. I worked for a year as a systems administrator for the School
of IT at the University of Pretoria.
Due to the concept based approach of my degree I am not only proficient in the languages and technolo-
gies that I have been taught, but I have the ability to learn similar languages and technologies fairly quickly.
In addition I also have strong people skills and am comfortable with leading meetings, delegating tasks and
enforcing deadlines.}%About me section
