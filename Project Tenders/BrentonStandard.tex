\aboutme{
Being in my third year of my IT degree, I can say that I have worked tremendously hard to get where I am today, I have put in many hours and a lot of dedication in the last two years of work and studying. There have been many challenges along the way but I feel that due to my tenacious personality I have overcome them. My work ethic is one which revolves around balance and I feel I achieved this incredibly well over the duration of this course. I am a hard worker with good people skills and have the interest and ability to learn and apply myself quickly.}%About me section
